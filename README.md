# Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to collect not only the candidates election results but the breakdown of total voter turnout for each county. 

### Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

### Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

As we can see from this analysis, we can rely on data analytic tools to provide total vote counts in an efficient amount of time. The system can caculate totals in the matter of seconds. The script used for this election was just one of many versions that can be used as it can be applied to any election to calculate and share total results. We can modify the text file with new data. If the headers remain the same then there is less need for modication in the code, simply the file path to the file we are reading from will need updating. Depending on the data given we can pull many insights to present. For example in this election, we can tell from the data that not only was Denver the county with the largest amount of votes but it actually made up roughly 83% of the total population of voters for this election. As a candidate in future elections this insight provides me  on how to plan more strategically next time
